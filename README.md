## About Me
I'm a software developer with 5 years experience as a full stack developer.
Currently during my 9-5 I work at Instanda as a software developer, as of now I'm on the integrations team which help integrate our PAAS with other platforms.
I've previously worked on the hotfix team fixing urgent bugs and on the performance team reducing inefficiencies within the platform.

Overall i've worked on large scale paas systems using .Net Core and Framework but also smaller projects using NextJS and Typescript.

# What am I currently working on?
I'm currently working on an ecommerce and games platform that sells powerpoint quizzes, which has a weekly interactive online quiz game with a real time leaderboard.
I've also recently create a few websites for clients such as a plumbing brochure site, a shopify arts website and another ecommerce platform for 3D printed goods.
